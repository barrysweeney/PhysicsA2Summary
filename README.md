A note relating to finding which configuration of capacitors is required to get a total capacitance of X has a minor error. It says to use the fact that voltage splits in parallel to find the total number of capacitors required in series and then how many of these parallele branches of capacitors in series is required to get the target total capacitance. This might not work for all use cases, for example where a configuration of 2 capactors in series, which are then placed in parallel with another capacitor is required.   
A note relating to neutral points is in the general section instead of the fields section.

Please reach out with any changes, especially regarding any general edge cases you've come across in past papers and general notes that would be helpful for all topics. Thanks!
